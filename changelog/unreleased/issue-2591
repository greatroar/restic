Bugfix: Fix reading passwords when standard input is redirected

Passwords are now read from the controlling terminal (on Unix) or the console
(on Windows), instead of from standard input. This means that commands that
read from a pipe, notably

    mysqldump my_database | restic backup --stdin

now no longer confuse the input for the password.

This means that reading the password from a file using shell redirection
syntax is no longer possible. Use the option `--password-file` instead.
